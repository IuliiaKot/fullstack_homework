# Background
Your mission is to create a webpage that displays a list of e-commerce products.  We expect it will take 3-4 hours to build this, and you have 1 week to submit your solution.  The reason we do homeworks is so that people can code in their natural environment where they are comfortable.  This way we can rely less on in-person coding during an interview.

# Guidelines
You can use any languages, databases and tools you want.
Submit your application on Github with a README file with build instructions, an explanation of the approach you took, and how you could potentially improve it in the future.

## Goal #1: load the product data into a database
- Create a schema for the data in [products.csv](https://github.com/bonobos/fullstack_homework/blob/master/products.csv) and [inventory.csv](https://github.com/bonobos/fullstack_homework/blob/master/inventory.csv)
- Load the data into a database

## Goal #2: make an api for the data
Create a web API to fetch the data you loaded into the database in part 1

## Goal #3: make a webpage that displays the data

Call the API you made in part 2 and display the list of products on the page
