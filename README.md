# Background
Your mission is to create a webpage that displays a list of e-commerce products.  We expect it will take 3-4 hours to build this, and you have 1 week to submit your solution.  The reason we do homeworks is so that people can code in their natural environment where they are comfortable.  This way we can rely less on in-person coding during an interview.

# Guidelines
Before starting the homework we recommend reading it in its entirety so that you have a broad understanding of what you're building. You can use any languages, databases and tools you want.
Submit your application on Github with a README file with build instructions, an explanation of the approach you took, and how you could potentially improve it in the future.

## Goal #1: load the product and inventory data into a database
- Create a schema for the data in [products.csv](https://github.com/bonobos/fullstack_homework/blob/master/products.csv) and [inventory.csv](https://github.com/bonobos/fullstack_homework/blob/master/inventory.csv)
  - products.csv contains a list of products and inventory.csv lists the inventory count for those products in various sizes and styles
- Load the data into a database

## Goal #2: make an api for the data
Create a web API to fetch the data you loaded into the database in part 1

## Goal #3: make a webpage that displays the data

Call the API you made in part 2 and display a list of the inventory grouped by product
